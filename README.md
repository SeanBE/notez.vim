# notez.vim

Yet another notes plugin! This is the outcome from me wanting to move away from vimwiki and "properly" learning vimscript.
I have nothing against vimwiki. I highly recommend it to everyone. It's packed with more features than I could ever need. 
Over time, I wanted slightly different behaviours for search, tags, you name it. There are plenty of alternatives that I could have used but this was my opportunity to finally build my own.
It does not come with any markdown goodies so so I recommend finding something else for that (e.g. plasticboy/vim-markdown)...or build your own ;)

### Installation
This has been tested on Vim 8.2. It requires the FZF binary, FZF vim plugin, and ripgrep.

TODO: ways of installing.
